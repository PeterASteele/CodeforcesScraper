This directory contains problem statements, in Latex, in one or more
languages. Typically it will just contain a file `problem.tex' which
contains a problem statement in English.

The Latex files should contain the problem text itself, including
input and output specifications, but not sample input and output. They
should reference auxiliary files (e.g., images) as if the working
directory is this directory.

Problem statements in other languages are provided in files named
`problem.<language>.tex', where <language> is an ISO 639-1 alpha-2
language code (e.g., "en" for English or "sv" for Swedish). For
English, either problem.tex or problem.en.tex can be used (but only
one of them).

GENERAL GUIDELINES

Try to keep your LATEX code as clean as possible, avoiding contorted
tweaks to get your problem to look like you want. It should be
possible to convert the problem statement to both pdf and html
reliably.

IMAGES

The graphics file formats supported are .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, and
.pdf. When including a file, say, "snarks.png", you can omit the
extension and just write "snarks", and let the system find the
appropriate file for you.

We distinguish between two types of pictures used in problem
statements: illustrations and figures.  

An illustration is a non-essential picture whose only purpose is to
make the problem statement look prettier. The template provides a
command \illustration{width%}{image}{attribution} to typeset
illustrations. Its arguments are:
- width%: a number between 0 and 1, the desired width of the
          illustration, as fraction of the total page width.
- image: the image file to be included.
- attribution: attribution for the image

A figure is an essential picture explaining or clarifying some part of
the problem statement. Figures should be typeset using the standard
Latex figure environment and \includegraphics (and possibly the
\subfigure command).  A typical use would be:
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{snarks}
\caption{The seven different snarks}
\label{fig:snarks}
\end{figure}

SPECIAL COMMANDS

The problem name is expected to not contain any Latex special
characters. In case it does, say if the problem name is $x^2 + y^2 =
z^2$, a "plain" version of the problem name can be specified by
writing
%% plainproblemname: x^2 + y^2 = z^2
